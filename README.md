## Important notes:
I've been able to meet the minimum requirements.
There is a slight but, as of turning this in, where the information level message, is stacked, when a level is repeated enough.
This is certainly not ideal, but it's what I've got.

I think it was a pretty fun assignment, and I enjoyed working on it.

Maybe I didn't go much further into the assignement, but I'm definitely gonna at some point.


Lastly, I just wanna say that I think it looks pretty good too, if I do say so myself.

Aaaaaand, good luck with the final level :wink:
